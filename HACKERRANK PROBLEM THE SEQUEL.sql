--Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.--
SELECT H.hacker_id, H.name 
FROM   submissions S 
   JOIN challenges C ON S.challenge_id = C.challenge_id 
   JOIN difficulty D ON C.difficulty_level = D.difficulty_level 
   JOIN hackers H ON S.hacker_id = H.hacker_id AND S.score = D.score 
GROUP  BY H.hacker_id, H.name 
HAVING Count(S.hacker_id) > 1 
ORDER  BY Count(S.hacker_id) DESC,  S.hacker_id ASC;
